0 Oct-24 21 20:07 He will win who knows when to fight and when not to fight.
0 Oct-24 21 20:07 In the midst of chaos, there is also opportunity.
0 Oct-24 21 20:07 Victorious warriors win first and then go to war, while defeated warriors go to war first and then seek to win.
0 Oct-24 21 20:07 If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles. If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat. If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle.
0 Oct-24 21 20:07 The greatest victory is that which requires no battle.
0 Oct-24 21 20:07 Quickness is the essence of the war.
0 Oct-24 21 20:07 There is no instance of a nation benefiting from prolonged warfare.
0 Oct-24 21 20:07 There are not more than five musical notes, yet the combinations of these five give rise to more melodies than can ever be heard.

There are not more than five cardinal tastes, yet combinations of them yield more flavours than can ever be tasted.
0 Oct-24 21 20:07 Who wishes to fight must first count the cost.
0 Oct-24 21 20:07 You have to believe in yourself.
0 Oct-24 21 20:07 Build your opponent a golden bridge to retreat across.
0 Oct-24 21 20:07 What the ancients called a clever fighter is one who not only wins, but excels in winning with ease.
0 Oct-24 21 20:07 The wise warrior avoids the battle.
0 Oct-24 21 20:07 The whole secret lies in confusing the enemy, so that he cannot fathom our real intent.
0 Oct-24 21 20:07 One mark of a great soldier is that he fight on his own terms or fights not at all.
0 Oct-24 21 20:07 If the mind is willing, the flesh could go on and on without many things.
0 Oct-24 21 20:07 Anger may in time change to gladness; vexation may be succeeded by content. But a kingdom that has once been destroyed can never come again into being; nor can the dead ever be brought back to life.
0 Oct-24 21 20:07 There are roads which must not be followed, armies which must not be attacked, towns which must not be besieged, positions which must not be contested, commands of the sovereign which must not be obeyed.
0 Oct-24 21 20:07 Attack is the secret of defense; defense is the planning of an attack.
0 Oct-24 21 20:07 Great results can be achieved with small forces.
0 Oct-24 21 20:07 Opportunities multiply as they are seized.
0 Oct-24 21 20:07 If quick, I survive. If not quick, I am lost. This is death.
0 Oct-24 21 20:07 To secure ourselves against defeat lies in our own hands, but the opportunity of defeating the enemy is provided by the enemy himself.
0 Oct-24 21 20:07 Bravery without forethought, causes a man to fight blindly and desperately like a mad bull. Such an opponent, must not be encountered with brute force, but may be lured into an ambush and slain.
0 Oct-24 21 20:07 Never venture, never win!
0 Oct-24 21 20:07 The skillful tactician may be likened to the shuai-jan. Now the shuai-jan is a snake that is found in the Chang mountains. Strike at its head, and you will be attacked by its tail; strike at its tail, and you will be attacked by its head; strike at its middle, and you will be attacked by head and tail both.
0 Oct-24 21 20:07 In battle, there are not more than two methods of attackthe direct and the indirect; yet these two in combination give rise to an endless series of maneuvers.
0 Oct-24 21 20:07 Plan for what it is difficult while it is easy, do what is great while it is small.
0 Oct-24 21 20:07 The opportunity of defeating the enemy is provided by the enemy himself.
0 Oct-24 21 20:07 Foreknowledge cannot be gotten from ghosts and spirits, cannot be had by analogy, cannot be found out by calculation. It must be obtained from people, people who know the conditions of the enemy.
0 Oct-24 21 20:07 If you fight with all your might, there is a chance of life; where as death is certain if you cling to your corner.
0 Oct-24 21 20:07 We cannot enter into alliances until we are acquainted with the designs of our neighbors.
0 Oct-24 21 20:07 When the outlook is bright, bring it before their eyes; but tell them nothing when the situation is gloomy.
0 Oct-24 21 20:07 If there is disturbance in the camp, the generals authority is weak.
0 Oct-24 21 20:07 Hence that general is skillful in attack whose opponent does not know what to defend; and he is skillful in defense whose opponent does not know what to attack.
0 Oct-24 21 20:07 Those skilled at making the enemy move do so by creating a situation to which he must conform; they entice him with something he is certain to take, and with lures of ostensible profit they await him in strength.
0 Oct-24 21 20:07 When your army has crossed the border, you should burn your boats and bridges, in order to make it clear to everybody that you have no hankering after home.
0 Oct-24 21 20:07 Be not afraid of greatness. Some are born great, some achieve greatness, and others have greatness thrust upon them.
0 Oct-24 21 20:07 We know what we are, but know not what we may be.
0 Oct-24 21 20:07 Sweet are the uses of adversity which, like the toad, ugly and venomous, wears yet a precious jewel in his head.
0 Oct-24 21 20:07 Our doubts are traitors and make us lose the good we oft might win by fearing to attempt.
0 Oct-24 21 20:07 Give every man thy ear, but few thy voice.
0 Oct-24 21 20:07 Uneasy lies the head that wears the crown.
0 Oct-24 21 20:07 Nothing can come of nothing.

0 Oct-24 21 20:07 Small cheer and great welcome makes a merry feast.
0 Oct-24 21 20:07 Sweet mercy is nobilitys true badge.
0 Oct-24 21 20:07 Neither a borrower nor a lender be.
0 Oct-24 21 20:07 Ambition should be made of sterner stuff.
0 Oct-24 21 20:07 I bear a charmed life.

0 Oct-24 21 20:07 Heat not a furnace for your foe so hot that it do singe yourself.
0 Oct-24 21 20:07 Nobody ever figures out what life is all about, and it doesn't matter. Explore the world. Nearly everything is really interesting if you go into it deeply enough. 
0 Oct-24 21 20:07 Study hard what interests you the most in the most undisciplined, irreverent and original manner possible.
0 Oct-24 21 20:07 You have no responsibility to live up to what other people think you ought to accomplish. I have no responsibility to be like they expect me to be. It's their mistake, not my failing. 
0 Oct-24 21 20:07 I learned very early the difference between knowing the name of something and knowing something.
0 Oct-24 21 20:07 The first principle is that you must not fool yourself and you are the easiest person to fool.
0 Oct-24 21 20:07 I... a universe of atoms, an atom in the universe. 
0 Oct-24 21 20:07 The highest forms of understanding we can achieve are laughter and human compassion.
0 Oct-24 21 20:07 I would rather have questions that can't be answered than answers that can't be questioned.
0 Oct-24 21 20:07 I think it's much more interesting to live not knowing than to have answers which might be wrong
0 Oct-24 21 20:07 If you thought that science was certain - well, that is just an error on your part. 
0 Oct-24 21 20:07 There are 10^11 stars in the galaxy. That used to be a huge number. But it's only a hundred billion. It's less than the national deficit! We used to call them astronomical numbers. Now we should call them economical numbers.
0 Oct-24 21 20:07 My life is a rather grim one. One day I shall perhaps describe it to you in great detail.
0 Oct-24 21 20:07 The only excursion of my life outside of New Orleans took me through the vortex to the whirlpool of despair: Baton Rouge. . . . New Orleans is, on the other hand, a comfortable metropolis which has a certain apathy and stagnation which I find inoffensive.
0 Oct-24 21 20:07 I should perhaps warn you that I am about to faint from anxiety and general depression, though. The film I saw last night was especially grueling, a teen-age beach musical. I almost collapsed during the singing sequence on surfboard.
0 Oct-24 21 20:07 Having once been so high, humanity fell so low. What had once been dedicated to the soul was now dedicated to the sale.
0 Oct-24 21 20:07 You could tell by the way he talked, though, that he had gone to school a long time. That was probably what was wrong with him.
0 Oct-24 21 20:07 Oh, Fortuna, blind, heedless goddess, I am strapped to your wheel,' Ignatius belched, 'Do not crush me beneath your spokes. Raise me on high, divinity.
0 Oct-24 21 20:07 I mingle with my peers or no one, and since I have no peers, I mingle with no one.
0 Oct-24 21 20:07 Whatever the mind of man can conceive and believe, it can achieve.

0 Oct-24 21 20:07 The best revenge is massive success.
0 Oct-24 21 20:07 Winning isnt everything, but wanting to win is.
0 Oct-24 21 20:07 The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second best time is now.

0 Oct-24 21 20:07 Everything has beauty, but not everyone can see.
0 Oct-24 21 20:07 There is only one way to avoid criticism: do nothing, say nothing, and be nothing.
0 Oct-24 21 20:07 People often say that motivation doesnt last. Well, neither does bathing. Thats why we recommend it daily.
0 Oct-24 21 20:07 Strive not to be a success, but rather to be of value.
0 Oct-24 21 20:07 I am at the moment writing a lengthy indictment against our century. When my brain begins to reel from my literary labors, I make an occasional cheese dip.
0 Oct-24 21 20:07 Do not swallow bait offered by the enemy. Do not interfere with an army that is returning home.
0 Oct-24 21 20:07 Religion is a culture of faith; science is a culture of doubt.
0 Oct-24 21 20:07 The worst calamities that befall an army arise from hesitation.
0 Oct-24 21 20:07 For a successful technology, reality must take precedence over public relations, for nature cannot be fooled.

0 Oct-24 21 20:10 If you want your children to turn out well, spend twice as much time with them, and half as much money.
0 Oct-24 21 20:10 Education costs money. But then so does ignorance.
0 Oct-24 21 20:10 There are no traffic jams along the extra mile.
0 Oct-24 21 20:10 Build your own dreams, or someone else will hire you to build theirs.
0 Oct-24 21 20:10 Do what you can, where you are, with what you have.
0 Oct-26 21 18:37 We are trying to prove ourselves wrong as quickly as possible, because only in that way can we find progress.
0 Oct-27 21 05:31 No legacy is so rich as honesty.
0 Oct-27 21 05:31 It’s not the years in your life that count. It’s the life in your years.
0 Oct-27 21 05:31 The question isn’t who is going to let me; it’s who is going to stop me.
0 Oct-27 21 05:31 When everything seems to be going against you, remember that the airplane takes off against

0 Oct-27 21 05:31 I would rather die of passion than of boredom.
0 Oct-27 21 05:31 The person who says it cannot be done should not interrupt the person who is doing it.

0 Oct-27 21 05:31 With the breakdown of the medieval system, the gods of chaos, lunacy, and bad taste gained ascendancy.
0 Oct-27 21 05:31 Our nation demands the scrutiny of a completely disengaged observer, and I already have a rather formidable collection of notes and jottings that evaluate and lend a perspective to the contemporary scene.
0 Oct-27 21 05:31 I suspect that we are teetering on the edge of the abyss.
0 Oct-27 21 05:31 It appeared that Vaseline had also been applied to the mustache, for it gleamed very brightly.
0 Oct-27 21 05:31 I am about to faint from anxiety and general depression. The film I saw last night was especially grueling, a teenage beach musical. I almost collapsed.
0 Oct-27 21 05:31 Finally, from so little sleeping and so much reading, his brain dried up and he went completely out of his mind.

0 Oct-27 21 05:31 El que lee mucho y anda mucho, ve mucho y sabe mucho.
0 Oct-27 21 05:31 Destiny guides our fortunes more favorably than we could have expected. Look there, Sancho Panza, my friend, and see those thirty or so wild giants, with whom I intend to do battle and kill each and all of them, so with their stolen booty we can begin to enrich ourselves. This is nobel, righteous warfare, for it is wonderfully useful to God to have such an evil race wiped from the face of the earth. What giants? Asked Sancho Panza. The ones you can see over there, answered his master, with the huge arms, some of which are very nearly two leagues long. Now look, your grace, said Sancho, what you see over there aren't giants, but windmills, and what seems to be arms are just their sails, that go around in the wind and turn the millstone. Obviously, replied Don Quijote, you don't know much about adventures.
0 Oct-27 21 05:31 And what’s he then that says I play the villain?
0 Oct-27 21 05:31 Virtue? A fig! 'Tis in ourselves that we are thus or thus.
0 Oct-27 21 05:31 Put money in thy purse.
0 Oct-27 21 05:31 Every man desires to live long, but no man wishes to be old.
0 Oct-27 21 05:31 Prepare to fight — for, evidently, you have found peace intolerable.
0 Oct-27 21 05:31 We can easily forgive a child who is afraid of the dark; the real tragedy of life is when men are afraid of the light.
0 Oct-27 21 05:31 I’ve missed more than 9000 shots in my career. I’ve lost almost 300 games. 26 times I’ve been trusted to take the game winning shot and missed. I’ve failed over and over and over again in my life. And that is why I succeed.

0 Oct-27 21 05:31 Arc, amplitude, and curvature sustain a similar relation to each other as time, motion, and velocity, or as volume, mass, and density.
0 Oct-27 21 05:31 I mean the word proof not in the sense of the lawyers, who set two half proofs equal to a whole one, but in the sense of a mathematician, where ½ proof = 0, and it is demanded for proof that every doubt becomes impossible.
0 Oct-27 21 05:31 Mathematics is the queen of sciences and number theory is the queen of mathematics. She often condescends to render service to astronomy and other natural sciences, but in all relations she is entitled to the first rank.
0 Oct-27 21 05:31 The perturbations which the motions of planets suffer from the influence of other planets, are so small and so slow that they only become sensible after a long interval of time;
0 Oct-27 21 05:31 I have had my results for a long time: but I do not yet know how I am to arrive at them.
0 Oct-27 21 05:31 You can never cross the ocean until you have the courage to lose sight of the shore.
0 Oct-27 21 05:31 Few things can help an individual more than to place responsibility on him, and to let him know that you trust him.
0 Oct-27 21 05:31 We must believe that we are gifted for something, and that this thing, at whatever cost, must be attained.
0 Oct-27 21 05:31 There is never jealousy where there is not strong regard.
0 Oct-27 21 05:31 Whenever a man’s friends begin to compliment him about looking young, he may be sure that they think he is growing old.

0 Nov-09 21 21:34 To crush your enemies, see them driven before you, and to hear the lamentation of their women! ~Conan the Pirate of Barbary
0 Nov-09 21 21:34 This is the story of how a new nation, saddled with war debt and desperate to establish credibility, was challenged by four Muslim powers. Our merchant ships were captured and the crews enslaved. Despite its youth, America would do what established western powers chose not to do: stand up to intimidation and lawlessness.
0 Nov-09 21 21:34 The Barbary states were already at war with America, and they seemed to understand only one kind of diplomacy—the kind that was accompanied by a cannon.
0 Nov-09 21 21:34 Tired of Americans being captured and held for ransom, our third president decided to take on the Barbary powers in a war that is barely remembered today but is one that, in many ways, we are still fighting.

1 Oct-26 21 05:31 There are five dangerous faults which may affect a general: (1) Recklessness, which leads to destruction; (2) cowardice, which leads to capture; (3) a hasty temper, which can be provoked by insults; (4) a delicacy of honor which is sensitive to shame; (5) over-solicitude for his men, which exposes him to worry and trouble.

1 Nov-02 21 05:31 The art of war is of vital importance to the State. It is a matter of life and death, a road either to safety or to ruin. Hence it is a subject of inquiry which can on no account be neglected.
1 Nov-03 21 05:31 Who does not know the evils of war cannot appreciate its benefits.
1 Nov-04 21 05:31 When life itself seems lunatic, who knows where madness lies? Perhaps to be too practical is madness. To surrender dreams — this may be madness. Too much sanity may be madness — and maddest of all: to see life as it is, and not as it should be!
1 Nov-05 21 05:31 Wheels of justice grind slow but grind fine.
