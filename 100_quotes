0 Oct-10 21 20:34 Never venture, never win!
0 Oct-10 21 20:34 The skillful tactician may be likened to the shuai-jan. Now the shuai-jan is a snake that is found in the Chang mountains.

0 Oct-10 21 20:34 Nobody ever figures out what life is all about, and it doesn't matter. Explore the world. Nearly everything is really interesting if you go into it deeply enough.
